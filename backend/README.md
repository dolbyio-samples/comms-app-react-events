# API Proxy setup

Use this proxy server sample code to connect your Dolby.io communications API based project to our backend services and correctly handle POST requests for features such as starting and stopping RTMP or RTS streams. You can read our [guide on webinars and virtual events](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/page/webinars-and-virtual-events) to understand in more detail about RTMP and RTS based streams.

**note** You do not need to run this project separately. By running the `yarn dev:events` command in the root of your cloned repository, you will start off both the backend project and front end project.
