# Dolby.io Events React App

## Run the demo directly

You can experience the Dolby.io events app without needing to clone and build the app using the `Deploy to Netlify` button. You will need:

- A Netlify account to which you're logged into
- Your Dolby.io App key and secret
- [Optional] Publisher and Subcriber tokens for PubNub. This is only needed if you would like to experience chat and promoting viewers to host.

Refer to [this guide](#how-to-get-a-dolbyio-account) on how to obtain your Dolby.io tokens and [this guide from PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/tutorials/javascript-sdk-chat-app/?step=set-up-environment) on how to obtain your PubNub tokens.

## Requirements and supported platforms

The app currently supports

- Chrome 100+
- Edge 100+
- Safari 111+
- Firefox 16.3+

## Getting Started

The following steps will quickly get you started testing the Dolby.io Communications APIs capabilities.

### Pre-requisites

To get started building this app you will need a Dolby.io account. You will also need the following -

- [NPM v8.11 or higher](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Yarn v1.22.19](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
- [Node v18.0.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Basic terminology

As you browse through the source code and documents, you might come across some of these terms

- **A host** is a participant with additional permissions to manage the conference and other participants.
- **A viewer** is a participant who can only receive video and audio stream from the conference.
- A **proxy-app-server** is an intermediary API server that communicates with the Dolby.io Communications Platform in order to provide functionality such as RTS/RTMP/HLS streaming or consuming web-hook data. You can see our sample implementation [here](./api-proxy).

### How to get a Dolby.io account

To setup your Dolby.io account, go to the [Dolby.io dashboard](https://dolby.io) and register for an account. After confirming your email address, you will be logged in.

> If you did not receive a verification email, check your Spam or Junk email folders.

#### Setting up your [Dolby.io](https://dashboard.dolby.io) app

To set up your app for events, you will need to:

1. Go to the _Dashboard_, and click `add new app` if you do not have an existing app. ![dashboard](./documentation/dashboard-events.png)
2. To enable events streaming, your app should be opted into the open beta program. You can find this at the bottom of the `Communications APIs` sidebar navigation when you click on your app. ![dashboard](./documentation/open-beta.png)

## How to run the Events app

Run the following steps after cloning the repository to run the application locally.

### Install dependencies

**note** : This guide is written with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) in mind. We have not validated this project with other package managers.

Open a terminal window in the root directory of your project folder. Install the project's dependencies using the following command.

```bash
yarn
```

### Repo structure

The code in this repository is organised in the following way

- The `src/` directory contains all the front-end code for the events app. Within this directory
  - `hooks/` contains wrapper functions around our SDK for re-usable functionality.
  - `components/` contains UI components that encapsulate and provide functionality.
  - `utils/` provides some generic helper functions.
  - `context/` contains the React Context for the side drawer and the main component window.
- The `api-proxy/` contains the code for the proxy server.

This project is built with the [Comms UI Kit for react](https://github.com/dolbyio/comms-uikit-react) library for simplicity and re-use of standard Communications API based components.

### Set up `.env` file

Create a new file called `.env` and copy the contents of `.env.example` into it.

You will need to provide the values for `KEY` and `SECRET` from your dolby.io app. To obtain your key and secret from the Dolby.io dashboard,

1. Go to the _Dashboard_, and click on the `API Keys` next to your application.
   ![dashboard](docs/img/dashboard.png)
2. On the next screen, copy the `App key` and `App secret` and paste them in your `.env` file against the marked variables.
   ![token](docs/img/client_access_token.png)

If you want chat and the ability to promote a viewer to host, you will need to provide your `PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY`, `PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY`, and `PUBNUB_SECRET_KEY` as well. To setup PubNub, please go through the [PubNub setup guide](customization.md/#enabling-chat-and-hot-swapping).

The secrets will not be exposed on the frontend.

#### Start the app

Execute the following command to run the application locally in a terminal window inside the `/events/` directory.

```bash
yarn dev
```

#### Open the app in a browser

After the appropriate message appears in the terminal window, open <http://localhost:3000> in the browser. The application will launch at this address and will look like the screenshot below.
