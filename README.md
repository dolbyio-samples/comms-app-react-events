# Dolby.io Events React App

## Run the demo directly

You can experience the Dolby.io events app without needing to clone and build the app using the `Deploy to Netlify` button. You will need:

- A Netlify account to which you're logged into
- Your Dolby.io App key and secret
- [Optional] Publisher and Subcriber tokens for PubNub. This is only needed if you would like to experience chat and promoting viewers to host.

Refer to [this guide](#how-to-get-a-dolbyio-account) on how to obtain your Dolby.io tokens and [this guide from PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/tutorials/javascript-sdk-chat-app/?step=set-up-environment) on how to obtain your PubNub tokens.
