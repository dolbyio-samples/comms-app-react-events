## Requirements and supported platforms

The app currently supports

- Chrome 100+
- Edge 100+
- Safari 111+
- Firefox 16.3+

## Getting Started

The following steps will quickly get you started testing the Dolby.io Communications APIs capabilities.

### Pre-requisites

To get started building this app you will need a Dolby.io account. You will also need the following -

- [NPM v8.11 or higher](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Yarn v1.22.19](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
- [Node v18.0.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Basic terminology

As you browse through the source code and documents, you might come across some of these terms

- **A host** is a participant with additional permissions to manage the conference and other participants.
- **A viewer** is a participant who can only receive video and audio stream from the conference.
- **A mixer app** is a web app based on the Dolby.io communications APIs that composes multiple streams of videos into a single stream and passes that on to any RTMP or webRTC based consumer. You can customise the participant layout positions using the Mixer config file. Refer to this [blog](https://dolby.io/blog/creating-a-custom-mixer-layout-for-streaming-a-conference/) for more details.
- A **proxy-app-server** is an intermediary API server that communicates with the Dolby.io Communications Platform in order to provide functionality such as RTS/RTMP/HLS streaming or consuming web-hook data. You can see our sample implementation [here](./api-proxy).

### How to get a Dolby.io account

To setup your Dolby.io account, go to the [Dolby.io dashboard](https://dolby.io) and register for an account. After confirming your email address, you will be logged in.

> If you did not receive a verification email, check your Spam or Junk email folders.

#### Setting up your [Dolby.io](https://dashboard.dolby.io) app

To set up your app for events, you will need to:

1. Go to the _Dashboard_, and click `add new app` if you do not have an existing app. ![dashboard](./documentation/dashboard-events.png)
2. To enable events streaming, your app should be opted into the open beta program. You can find this at the bottom of the `Communications APIs` sidebar navigation when you click on your app. ![dashboard](./documentation/open-beta.png)

## How to run the Events app

Run the following steps after cloning the repository to run the application locally.

### Install dependencies

**note** : This guide is written with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) in mind. We have not validated this project with other package managers.

Open a terminal window in the root directory of your project folder. Install the project's dependencies using the following command.

```bash
yarn
```

### Repo structure

The code in this repository is organised in the following way

- The `src/` directory contains all the front-end code for the events app. Within this directory
  - `hooks/` contains wrapper functions around our SDK for re-usable functionality.
  - `components/` contains UI components that encapsulate and provide functionality.
  - `utils/` provides some generic helper functions.
  - `context/` contains the React Context for the side drawer and the main component window.
- The `api-proxy/` contains the code for the proxy server.

This project is built with the [Comms UI Kit for react](https://github.com/dolbyio/comms-uikit-react) library for simplicity and re-use of standard Communications API based components.

### Proxy Server code

Please follow the guide in the [api-proxy read me](./api-proxy/README.md) to get your proxy server up and running. This is required for the events app to function.

#### Start the app

Execute the following command to run the application locally in a terminal window inside the root directory.

> You will need a second terminal instance along with the one that runs your web proxy code.

```bash
yarn dev
```

#### Open the app in a browser

After the appropriate message appears in the terminal window, open <http://localhost:3000> in the browser. The application will launch at this address.

> If the app isn't loading, make sure you've started the proxy server.

> If you want to start your proxy server on a port other than :4000, you can make a .env file and set the proxy server location using the `VITE_API_PROXY_URL` variable.
